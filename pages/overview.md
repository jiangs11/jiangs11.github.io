## Summary

Junior Software Engineer with a strong desire to identify, learn, and apply new software technologies. Programming languages that I mainly specialize in are Java and Python. My current job (remote) is at [Innovative Defense Technologies](https://idtus.com/) working on systems for various government contracts. I graduated from Rowan University in 2021 with both my Bachelor's of Science and Master's of Science in Computer Science. During my downtime, I enjoy playing basketball, practicing Chinese calligraphy, and trying to learn a new software tool, language, or concept.
